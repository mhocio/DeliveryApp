## How to run the project
In order to run the routing image with publishing a containerâ€™s port (5000) to the host:
- run the following command in the folder [routing](routing/) : <br> ```docker run -t -i -p 5000:5000 -v "${PWD}:/data" osrm/osrm-backend osrm-routed --algorithm mld /data/mazowieckie-latest.osrm``` <br>
In case you want to increase the limit of points of the trip, add the following flag to the command above: <br>
```--max-tri-size=1000```
- Start the [DeliveryApi.sln](DeliveryApi/DeliveryApi/DeliveryApi.sln) and run the project.
